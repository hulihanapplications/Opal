h1. How To Install Opal

h2. Get Opal 

Opal is available at the following places:

* "Official Website":http://www.hulihanapplications.com/projects/opal
* "Github":https://github.com/hulihanapplications/Opal

If you have git installed on your server, you can install it directly from Github. This is highly recommended and makes updating Opal a breeze.

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/hulihanapplications/Opal.git
</pre>

h2. Install Gems

Install all of Opal's required gems using bundler:

<pre>
cd Opal
bundle install 
</pre>

You may get an error here regarding "rmagick":http://dev.hulihanapplications.com/wiki/opal/RMagick if you don't have it already installed. Check out this "Wiki Guide":http://dev.hulihanapplications.com/wiki/opal/RMagick for help.  

h2. Install Opal 

Next, Run these commands (while in the Opal directory) to install Opal's required stuff (database structure, assets, etc.) in production mode: 

<pre>
bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production LOCALE=en
bundle exec rake db:seed RAILS_ENV=production LOCALE=en
bundle exec rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production 
</pre>

These commands will create the database structure of Opal in production mode. If you leave out *RAILS_ENV=PRODUCTION*, everything will be installed into your development database instead. This will also set up the default admin account, some sample items(you'll be asked if you want to install sample data), and other stuff to help you get started with Opal. You can also specify the *LOCALE* parameter to install Opal in a language other than english. 
  * If you want to automate an Opal installation, or if you just want to bypass prompts(that ask you if you want to install sample data and other stuff: run this command: _bundle exec rake db:seed PROMPTS=FALSE_)

h2. That's it! 

You can now start Opal using the built-in Rails webserver, WEBrick... 

<pre>
bundle exec rails s -e production
</pre>

...or any of your other favorite webservers: thin, nginx, apache, mongrel, etc.
 
* To log in to Opal for the first time, the default Admin username and password is: *admin*.

h1. Updating Opal

If you installed Opal with git, updating is a piece of cake. Go to your Opal directory and run these commands: 

<pre>
git pull origin master # pull the latest stable version of Opal
rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
</pre>

That's it!
